👋 Hi, I’m @MR-robot005  
👀 I’m passionate about Cybersecurity, C/C++, Operating Systems, and Networking  
🌱 Currently exploring C internals, Memory Management, Web Development, and Flutter  
💻 I enjoy low-level coding, system programming, and ethical hacking  
🛠️ Love to optimize, debug, and push systems to their limits  
💞️ Open to collaborate on security tools, OS projects, and unique Java/C++ ideas  
📫 Reach me through GitHub or collab requests
